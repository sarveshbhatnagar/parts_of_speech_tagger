SOMEWORD The acquisition included Merrill Lynch Realty , Merrill Lynch Relocation Management and related businesses operating within the Fine Homes master limited partnership . SOMEWORD At the same time , Merrill Lynch said its Merrill Lynch Mortgage Corp. unit had closed the cash tender offer for all Fine Homes preference units outstanding . SOMEWORD Merrill Lynch said that based on a preliminary count , about 6.4 million Fine Homes units were tendered , or 82 % of those outstanding . SOMEWORD In conjunction with the offer 's closing , Fine Homes directors declared a cash distribution on the partnership 's subordinated units of 91 cents a unit , or about $ 19.6 million . SOMEWORD Those units were beneficially owned by Merrill Lynch , which has distributed them to holders of preference units . SOMEWORD Merrill Lynch began its offer to purchase all of the preference units of Fine Homes last month . SOMEWORD Investor Asher B. Edelman , who bought 30 % of Datapoint Corp. 's stock last week to try to head off a battle for control , purchased most of the shares with funds from another company he controls . SOMEWORD According to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Intelogic Trace Inc. , San Antonio , spent almost $ 15.5 million from working capital and other funds to purchase more than 2.5 million Datapoint shares , or about a 25 % stake . SOMEWORD Mr. Edelman is chairman of both Datapoint , a maker of computer products , and Intelogic Trace , a computer services company that was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985 . SOMEWORD Previously , Intelogic owned less than 3 % of Datapoint . SOMEWORD In the SEC filings , Mr. Edelman said he purchased the shares because New York investor Martin S. Ackerman has begun a consent solicitation to replace Mr. Edelman and the rest of the Datapoint board with Mr. Ackerman and his nominees . SOMEWORD Because of the purchases , Mr. Edelman and companies he controls now own about 40 % of Datapoint . SOMEWORD To succeed in his consent solicitation , Mr. Ackerman would have to gather votes of holders of more than 50 % of Datapoint 's shares . SOMEWORD Mr. Ackerman has said he is considering a legal challenge to Mr. Edelman 's purchases , among other options . SOMEWORD Mr. Edelman could n't be reached for comment . SOMEWORD An Intelogic spokesman said the company does n't have any comment beyond the filings . SOMEWORD Mr. Edelman and other Intelogic officers and directors own 14.5 % of the company 's stock . SOMEWORD The ABC network , which has been locked out of the financially lucrative late-night market , is studying program proposals , ranging from comedy to news shows , to air in the time slot after its highly rated `` Nightline . SOMEWORD '' Late-night success has eluded the Capital Cities\\\\/ABC Inc. subsidiary for the last five years . SOMEWORD A one-hour `` Nightline '' quickly bombed , as did talk shows with Greg Jackson , Jimmy Breslin and Dick Cavett . SOMEWORD The most recent attempt , `` Day 's End , '' which offered a review of the day 's news and highlights from the network 's `` Good Morning America '' talk show , was dropped last spring after 13 weeks of market testing in 28 cities . SOMEWORD Currently , ABC ceases programming at midnight and the network 's 200-plus affiliates program the late-night period themselves , generally with syndicated shows or movies . SOMEWORD By contrast , CBS Inc. 's affiliates air `` The Pat Sajak Show '' and affiliates of General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. get `` The Tonight Show '' and `` Late Night With David Letterman . SOMEWORD '' ABC hopes to have a project ready to show stations at January 's National Association of Television Programming Executives convention in New Orleans , where syndicators hawk their new shows . SOMEWORD Among the proposals ABC is studying are four comedy-oriented shows , which are typically a hit with men aged 18-34 , the demographic group most desired by advertisers . SOMEWORD `` Products like soft drinks , shampoo , sneakers , beer and beauty-care products are all looking for late-night shows to reach their audience , '' said Bill Croasdale , senior vice president and director of network sales at the ad agency Backer Spielvogel Bates , a subsidiary of Saatchi & Saatchi Co . SOMEWORD `` ABC has yet to get a foothold in that door and it must . SOMEWORD It 's just too valuable a time period to keep ignoring . SOMEWORD '' Last year , programs airing after 11:30 p.m. accounted for $ 429 million in total advertising revenues for the three networks , although ABC earned only about $ 61 million . SOMEWORD Late-night competition for young adults has increased recently , especially with the addition of `` The Arsenio Hall Show , '' syndicated by Paramount Television , a unit of Paramount Communications Inc . SOMEWORD CBS may cut the 90-minute `` Pat Sajak Show '' to one-hour and air a comedy-oriented show at 12:30 a.m . SOMEWORD Among the hosts ABC is looking at for comedy projects are Rick Dees , a popular Los Angeles disk jockey , Jeff MacGregor , a former host of the canceled syndicated show `` The New Dating Game , '' and standup comedian Kevin Meaney . SOMEWORD Another possible show involves Merrill Markoe , who was once head writer at NBC 's `` Late Night With David Letterman . SOMEWORD '' In addition , Koppel Communications Inc. , an independent production company headed by `` Nightline '' anchor Ted Koppel , has offered a proposal for a one-hour , news-oriented program , a spokeswoman for Mr. Koppel said . SOMEWORD Mr. Croasdale of Backer Spielvogel said ABC would face a tough task if it tried to follow a news broadcast with an entertainment show because of the different audiences the shows attract . SOMEWORD Michael Brockman , president of late-night , daytime and children 's programming at ABC , acknowledged the juxtaposition could pose a problem . SOMEWORD `` The dilemma we face in creating a midnight show is one created by the success of 'Nightline , ' `` Mr. Brockman said . SOMEWORD `` There is n't really enough advertiser support for another news show . SOMEWORD And there is n't any intelligent way to extend 'Nightline , ' so I 've decided to create a program in which I 'll have to recruit almost an entirely new audience . SOMEWORD '' ABC wo n't produce `` a talk show per se with a desk and sofa , '' said Mr. Brockman , who , prior to joining ABC , launched `` The Pat Sajak Show '' on CBS . SOMEWORD `` We 're tapping the strengths of the personalities involved with each project . SOMEWORD '' Some affiliates said they were skeptical about ABC 's potential for success . SOMEWORD One reason is that the affiliates have purchased syndicated programs and movie packages and are unwilling to move those shows for an untested ABC project . SOMEWORD `` I just spent millions of dollars last year on a movie package that would last me five years , '' said an ABC affiliate general manager , who asked not be identified . SOMEWORD `` I do n't think I would initially take something offered by the network . SOMEWORD '' Mr. Brockman admitted that support among ABC affiliates would be an `` uphill battle , '' mostly because the network in the past has failed to demonstrate long-term support for any program that followed `` Nightline . SOMEWORD '' `` Because of the past inconsistency , { the affiliates } have a'show me ' attitude and I do n't blame them , '' Mr. Brockman said . SOMEWORD ABC ca n't even count on the eight stations it owns , since they are allowed to run autonomously . SOMEWORD For example , WABC in New York did n't run the programs hosted by Messrs. Breslin and Cavett when the network aired them , and ran a syndicated talk show , since canceled , with comedian David Brenner instead . SOMEWORD CFM International Inc. , a consortium of General Electric Co. and France 's Snecma , received a $ 497.7 million Air Force contract for replacing engines on KC-135 tanker aircraft . SOMEWORD United Technologies Corp. got $ 319.2 million in Air Force contracts for the Advanced Tactical Fighter engine , other aircraft parts and Navy submarine research . SOMEWORD Hughes Aircraft Co. , a unit of General Motors Corp. , received $ 174.6 million in contracts for air-defense tests and battlefield-electronic equipment for the Army , and missiles and aircraft radars for the Air Force . SOMEWORD McDonnell Douglas Corp. won $ 105.9 million in contracts for Navy drone aircraft and Harpoon missile improvements , and Air Force KC-10 aircraft support . SOMEWORD Other contracts announced by the Pentagon went to : -- Martin Marietta Corp. , $ 36.5 million from the Air force for Titan missile parts and manufacturing technology . SOMEWORD -- General Dynamics Corp. , $ 33.9 million from the Air Force for F-16 electronics and advanced fighter research .

Gray was amazingly unscientific in his Aug. 17 editorial-page article , `` Nuclear Reactors Everyone Will Love . SOMEWORD '' New is not synonymous with successful . SOMEWORD It is synonymous with untried . SOMEWORD His premise is fundamentally unsound . SOMEWORD He criticizes water-cooled reactor technology -- which is the standard throughout the non-communist world -- for the size and complexity of plants designed 15 and 20 years ago . SOMEWORD And he praises gas-cooled technology -- which has been abandoned by virtually the entire world , after decades of development and billions of dollars -- for advanced safety characteristics that they could incorporate at some indefinite time in the future . SOMEWORD Virtually every theoretical advantage that he attributes to gas-cooled reactors already is being applied to advanced water-reactor technology . SOMEWORD The next water-cooled power plants will incorporate a number of major improvements over those of the past -- they most likely will be much smaller , modular , simpler , and they will have passive safety systems that do not require skilled operators . SOMEWORD Gas-cooled reactors could well have these features when they are designed , tested , developed , prototyped , licensed and ready for commercial use in three or four decades . SOMEWORD Advanced water-cooled reactors , based on successful operating experience around the world for more than a quarter of a century , will offer these advances in the mid-1990s . SOMEWORD Gas-reactor technology could become an efficient and effective source of electricity in the 21st century . SOMEWORD But we ca n't wait for decades to tackle such pressing problems as finding substitutes for imported oil , cutting back on the burning of fossil fuels to reduce environmental problems , and meeting the growing demand for electricity . SOMEWORD We need water-cooled reactors that incorporate all these advances -- and that will exist in the near future when we need them . SOMEWORD Walter Meyer Director Institute for Energy Research Syracuse University Syracuse , N.Y . SOMEWORD Based on more than 40 years of experience operating utility power plants , I question the economics of Mr. Gray 's modular reactors . SOMEWORD A good large plant will overwhelm the good small plant of similar technology every time . SOMEWORD The economics of big nuclear plants has not been destroyed by their large scale nor by their safety record but by unconscionable delays . SOMEWORD The utility must be confident that unexpected regulatory delays are improbable unless a real safety threat is established . SOMEWORD Until then no prudent utility is likely to propose any nuclear project . SOMEWORD The physical size of the gas-cooled reactor module can only be very large , since the graphite core alone will probably be larger than the core and pressure vessel of the `` big '' conventional nuclear plant . SOMEWORD Since it will take 10 gas-cooled reactor modules to match the output of a single conventional nuclear plant , that means 10 control systems , 10 construction projects , and staffs to maintain and run 10 units . SOMEWORD Process engineering using conventional scaling factors would indicate that the total project costs of the 10 small gas-cooled plants would be roughly twice those of the large conventional plant . SOMEWORD Robert M. Lundberg Los Altos , Calif . SOMEWORD Consumer price growth in the 24 leading Western industrial nations eased to a monthly rate of 0.2 % in July from 0.3 % in June , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said . SOMEWORD The OECD said the latest result , which is an average of price-growth figures supplied by its 24 member countries , left the year-on-year inflation rate unchanged at 5.3 % for the third consecutive month . SOMEWORD The slowdown in monthly price growth for July was marked by a 0.2 % contraction of energy prices , the first absolute decline since last November . SOMEWORD Energy prices were up 0.4 % in June . SOMEWORD Food-price growth slowed to 0.4 % in July from 0.5 % in June , while the growth rate for non-food , non-energy prices was unchanged at 0.2 % . SOMEWORD On a year-on-year basis , energy prices were up 5.2 % in July , food prices were ahead 5.6 % and non-food , non-energy prices showed a 4.4 % increase . SOMEWORD Southern National Corp. said it agreed to acquire Western Carolina Savings & Loan Association in a stock swap valued at $ 17.5 million . SOMEWORD Under the agreement , which is subject to regulatory approval , Southern National would pay 1,188,690 of its shares for all Western Carolina stock and stock options outstanding . SOMEWORD Southern National currently has 19,043,380 common shares outstanding . SOMEWORD Southern National , a bank holding company , has about $ 2.87 billion in assets . SOMEWORD Western Carolina , Valdese , N.C. , has $ 76 million in assets . SOMEWORD The agreement represents the first purchase of a savings and loan company by Southern National . SOMEWORD personalized advertising in its weekly magazines -- is expected to pull in an extra $ 20 million to $ 25 million in ad revenue in its first year alone , says Donald M. Elliman Jr. , the magazine group 's executive vice president of marketing . SOMEWORD The figure is surprisingly large for a start-up program , and shows just how important the new plan will be in generating ad revenue for the magazine group in the 1990s . SOMEWORD Indeed , Time magazine group officials are already planning to expand the program , which premieres in January , to include more magazines and types of ads . SOMEWORD The plan , known as Target Select , initially includes Time , People and Sports Illustrated , as well as Money and Entertainment Weekly on a more limited basis . SOMEWORD Target Select uses a computerized process known as selective binding to place different ads in different subscribers ' magazine copies . SOMEWORD The process can also personalize ads , greeting subscribers by name or listing a local store address . SOMEWORD In effect , it allows Time 's national magazines to compete head-to-head with local newspapers and with direct mail . SOMEWORD `` Subscribers can receive Time publications whose ads have information geared specifically towards them , '' says Bruce Judson , the magazine group 's director of marketing , who spearheaded the program under Mr. Elliman . SOMEWORD `` The possibilities are tremendous . SOMEWORD '' Target Select wo n't be announced officially until Friday , but it 's already jolting other publishers into action , and could well transform the magazine ad business . SOMEWORD While selective binding has been around for about 15 years , it had been used only by a handful of smaller magazines like Farm Journal . SOMEWORD But Time 's titles account for about 20 % of all U.S. magazine ad revenue , and any splash Time makes tends to turn into a tidal wave . SOMEWORD Hearst and Diamandis Communications are among the magazine publishers now exploring selective binding . SOMEWORD Ziff-Davis 's PC Magazine is testing the process . SOMEWORD And industry executives say Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek is scrambling to be able to offer its own program early next year to compete with Time . SOMEWORD No other magazine companies , though , have the reach of Time ; its three weeklies alone have combined circulation of almost 10.5 million and had ad revenue of $ 942 million in 1988 . SOMEWORD Still , Time is making an expensive gamble . SOMEWORD It has invested millions in a new technology that could well turn out to be a very expensive gimmick . SOMEWORD Time declines to quantify its investment , but says the program will be profitable in its first year . SOMEWORD Other magazine publishers are watching carefully : `` Selective binding has been around for 15 years , and no one has really been able to make it work right , '' says Claeys Bahrenburg , group publishing director at Hearst magazines , publisher of Cosmopolitan and Redbook . SOMEWORD Mr. Bahrenburg says Hearst has created a task force to look into selective binding , and says it is considering using the technology not just for advertisers , but to tailor articles to subscribers . SOMEWORD Sports Afield , for example , could give fishing buffs a heavier dose of angling articles . SOMEWORD But Mr. Bahrenburg adds that magazines using selective binding to personalize ads may risk undermining their national ad base and hurting their overall cachet . SOMEWORD `` This raises some major issues on how we sell our product : You 're selling demographic slices '' rather than a national magazine , he says . SOMEWORD Mr. Judson , however , counters that Target Select `` enhances the franchise of Time magazines . SOMEWORD '' In any case , Target Select is expensive enough that it does n't seem likely to spark an immediate stampede away from national ads . SOMEWORD The plan , in part , will allow marketers to advertise specifically to three groups of subscribers : catalog shoppers , people who have recently moved and affluent readers over 50 years old . SOMEWORD A furniture company , for example , could advertise only in magazine copies going to subscribers who just moved . SOMEWORD But that kind of pinpointing , derived largely from reader surveys , does n't come cheap . SOMEWORD Time magazine currently charges about $ 28 to reach each 1,000 subscribers . SOMEWORD But advertisers who want to target high income older people -- and Time promises to reach 700,000 of them via the three weeklies and Money -- will pay more than double that rate , or about $ 68 for each 1,000 , according to the 1990 rate card . SOMEWORD Reaching recent movers will cost $ 51 for each 1,000 . SOMEWORD Target Select also will use a process called ink-jet printing to allow national advertisers to personalize their ads . SOMEWORD An auto maker 's ad could list the nearest dealership , or even offer a discount to selected subscribers . SOMEWORD Depending on complexity , industry executives say ink-jet printing can add 35 % to the cost of an ad , and could even double the price . SOMEWORD Even more costly , Time is offering customized programs for advertisers . SOMEWORD American Express , for example , could place personalized ads only in magazine copies going to gold-card-carrying subscribers . SOMEWORD `` The day is here when magazine advertisers can be as personalized as direct mail , '' Mr. Judson says . SOMEWORD Indeed , the ink-jet capability is sure to make a lot of direct marketers angry , and it 's certain to scare newspapers , which are already facing a bleak retail ad market . SOMEWORD It swipes especially hard at cooperative ads , in which a retail outlet and a brand share a single ad ; the ink-jetting program can tailor a national ad right down to the zip-code level , listing the nearest retail outlet where a nationally advertised brand is sold . SOMEWORD `` It 's better targeting than anything available in local newspapers , '' Mr. Judson says . SOMEWORD Ad Notes . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD NEW ACCOUNTS : Times Mirror Co. , Los Angeles , awarded the $ 5 million ad account for its Newsday and New York Newsday newspapers to Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss , New York . SOMEWORD The account had been handled by Holland & Callaway Advertising , New York . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD Glenbrook Laboratories , a unit of Sterling Drug , said Lintas New York and Dugan\\\\/Farley Communications Associates , Upper Saddle River , N.J. , will handle advertising for Therapy Bayer Aspirin , a new analgesic . SOMEWORD Lintas , a unit of the Interpublic Group , will handle consumer ads ; Dugan\\\\/Farley will create a trade campaign . SOMEWORD Billings have n't been determined . SOMEWORD Ex-smokers , beware : You run an increased chance of suffering a stroke for at least 10 years after you stop smoking . SOMEWORD That 's a lot longer than the two to five years shown in previous research . SOMEWORD The sobering conclusion , based on an Australian study of 422 stroke victims , may discourage some smokers from quitting and crimp increasingly popular anti-smoking drives in the U.S. and Europe . SOMEWORD `` There is the danger of people saying , 'Why stop smoking ? SOMEWORD Is it worth it ? SOMEWORD ' '' said Dr. Godfrey Fowler , a physician at Oxford University 's Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford , England , who studies smoking . SOMEWORD For just this reason , `` researchers have been very nervous about publishing such a result . SOMEWORD From a public-health point of view , it might be counterproductive , '' agreed Dr. Roger Shinton , an epidemiologist and stroke specialist at Dudley Road Hospital in Birmingham , England . SOMEWORD But Dr. Shinton saw a larger significance in the Australian study , reported in this week 's issue of the Lancet , a leading British medical journal . SOMEWORD Public-health officials no longer can `` say it 's all right to smoke as long as you stop before you get into trouble . SOMEWORD That 's an out-of-date message . SOMEWORD '' The new message should be `` never smoke , because if you smoke at all for any given length of time , the risk you get... never leaves you . SOMEWORD '' The latest research , led by a University of Melbourne team , also found much stronger links between current smokers and stroke -- plus indications that smokers ' spouses also may be more likely to suffer strokes . SOMEWORD `` The persistent nature of the risk even after cessation of smoking and the possible risk associated with passive exposure strengthens public-health arguments against smoking , '' wrote Dr. Geoffrey A. Donnan , the lead researcher , in the Lancet report . SOMEWORD Compared with nonsmokers , smokers in the Australian study experienced a three to four times greater risk of developing the most common type of stroke . SOMEWORD Earlier investigations found smokers ' risk was two to three times greater . SOMEWORD The new findings back the long-suspected relationship between stroke and smoking , said Dr. John Bamford , a neurologist at St. James University Hospital in Leeds , England . SOMEWORD `` This goes along with what has been established in coronary disease for several years . SOMEWORD '' Strokes , the result of interference with the brain 's blood supply , are the third leading cause of death in both the U.S. and Europe . SOMEWORD Many victims survive their first stroke only to die from subsequent ones . SOMEWORD The Australian scientists compared the stroke patients ' smoking patterns , other personal habits and health history against those of a similar-sized control group from the Melbourne area . SOMEWORD Ex-smokers showed a lower risk of developing strokes than current smokers , and this hazard diminished over time . SOMEWORD But `` this trend was not significant , and an appreciable risk was still apparent after 10 years , '' the Lancet article reported . SOMEWORD The Australian researchers said their surprising observation differed from two prior studies because those involved fewer ex-smokers . SOMEWORD Any smokers discouraged by the latest research should remember that `` by changing from a current to an ex - ( smoker ) , you are still dropping your ( stroke ) risk considerably , '' Dr. Shinton noted . SOMEWORD Nonsmokers in the Australian study ran a 60 % greater chance of developing a stroke if their spouses smoked . SOMEWORD While the observation was n't statistically significant , it marks the first time scientists have detected a potential link between so-called passive smoking and stroke . SOMEWORD Charles Gardner , a former Unisys Corp. vice president who pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and making illegal campaign contributions in the Pentagon procurement scandal , was sentenced to 32 months in jail and fined $ 40,000 . SOMEWORD Mr. Gardner ran the Unisys surveillance and fire-control unit in Great Neck , N.Y . SOMEWORD Investigators have described him as the most important defendant charged so far in the three-year investigation and say he is an important link to the central targets of the inquiry . SOMEWORD Mr. Gardner , who has been cooperating with prosecutors , was accused of systematically using funds from sham consulting contracts and other corrupt practices to set up a secret web of foreign and domestic bank accounts intended for bribes , illegal campaign contributions and for personal use . SOMEWORD In March , Mr. Gardner pleaded guilty to bribing former Navy research chief Melvyn Paisley by helping to arrange the purchase of an Idaho condominium from Mr. Paisley at an inflated price . SOMEWORD Through his lawyers , Mr. Paisley has denied any wrongdoing . SOMEWORD James Neal , a former Unisys consultant and close associate of Mr. Gardner who also pleaded guilty to bribery-related charges , was sentenced to 27 months in jail and fined $ 30,000 . SOMEWORD Mr. Neal has admitted conspiring with Mr. Gardner to bribe Mr. Paisley and to participating in a bribery scheme to funnel $ 400,000 to a Bahamas company owned by Garland Tomlin , a Navy acquisition official awaiting sentencing for his activities . SOMEWORD Southdown Inc. , Houston , said Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. agreed to buy Southdown 's Pelto Oil Co. operation for about $ 320 million . SOMEWORD Earlier this month , Southdown announced it had hired Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to help it sell Pelto and that it planned to use the proceeds to pay down long-term debt . SOMEWORD Pelto assets last Dec. 31 included proved reserves of 169.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 7.2 million barrels of crude oil and condensate . SOMEWORD Southdown , a producer of cement and concrete products , said the final sale price is subject to adjustment based on working capital figures and certain other conditions . SOMEWORD It said it expects to close the transaction by November 15 . SOMEWORD Newark , N.J.-based Public Service Enterprise Group is a public utility holding company . SOMEWORD The World Bank , with its capital recently boosted , actually reduced its net lending to the developing world in its latest financial year . SOMEWORD In its annual report to be released today , the international agency said lending minus repayments at its main unit , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , fell 44 % to $ 1.9 billion from $ 3.4 billion the year earlier . SOMEWORD Gross lending at the IBRD in the year ended June 30 fell slightly to $ 11.3 billion from $ 11.6 billion . SOMEWORD However , this lending contraction probably wo n't last long . SOMEWORD The World Bank 's IBRD unit , which has 151 nation members , approved loans totaling $ 16.4 billion , an increase of 11 % from $ 14.8 billion for the previous year , indicating disbursements will soon pick up . SOMEWORD The bank also said it expects to lend between $ 20 billion and $ 25 billion in its current year . SOMEWORD There is considerable frustration in the developing world that the World Bank has n't lent more actively , especially when some other lenders are pulling back from these nations . SOMEWORD The World Bank , its critics say , has just had a capital increase and is awash with funds that it could lend to the developing world . SOMEWORD But supporters of the World Bank contend it is constrained by the lack of economic management in the countries themselves . SOMEWORD The bank links an increasing proportion of its lending to broad economic programs in developing countries . SOMEWORD World Bank supporters say that if developing countries do n't have credible economic programs , the bank must hold back its lending . SOMEWORD For example , in the fiscal year just ended , the World Bank approved loans of only $ 700 million for projects in Brazil , while it approved $ 2.23 billion of credits for projects in Mexico , which has followed more rigorous and orthodox economic policies . SOMEWORD Like many other lenders to the developing world , both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are having growing problems with late payments on their loans . SOMEWORD The World Bank and its International Development Association unit , which makes loans and grants to the poorest countries , have overdue principal and interest payments on almost $ 4 billion of loans , an increase from about $ 3.4 billion of such troubled loans the year before . SOMEWORD The list of bad borrowers remains virtually the same , with Peru , Zambia , Panama , Syria , Honduras and Nicaragua holding the largest outstanding arrears as of June 30 . SOMEWORD Meanwhile , one of the World Bank 's sister institutions , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , forecast that recent robust growth in world trade will be sustained this year . SOMEWORD The Geneva-based international trade treaty organization said in its annual review of international trade that it expects growth of about 7 % in the volume of world merchandise trade this year , following estimated growth of about 8.5 % in Among other things , GATT attributes the predicted continued growth in world trade to technological innovation , lower oil prices , the growing importance of manufactured exports , the growth of international joint ventures and mergers , and the greater integration of national financial markets . SOMEWORD A federal jury decided against awarding any punitive damages to the daughter of the founder of Mail Boxes Etc. , who claimed that the company and its top official fraudulently induced her to sell her 23 % stake . SOMEWORD Thursday , the jury had awarded plaintiff Nancy Tash , daughter of the company 's late founder , Gerald Aul , $ 2.5 million in compensatory damages to be paid by the company . SOMEWORD The jury further found that Anthony DeSio , Mail Boxes ' president and chief executive officer , should pay more than $ 1.5 million in compensatory damages . SOMEWORD Herbert Goffstein , a defendant and a former company official , was n't found liable for any damages . SOMEWORD In her lawsuit , Ms. Tash alleged that the company and Mr. DeSio defrauded her in 1983 by inducing her to sell 700,000 shares of the company 's stock for $ 50,000 and a $ 300,000 note to a new company controlled by Mr. DeSio . SOMEWORD Ms. Tash alleged that Mr. DeSio had devised a scheme to make her believe that the company was performing poorly , when it was in fact posting higher sales . SOMEWORD The company said it plans to appeal the verdict . SOMEWORD Mail Boxes Etc. is a franchiser of postal-business and communication-service centers . SOMEWORD It said its insurance carriers have reserved rights to deny liability for actual coverage of the award and maintain that the company 's policy limit is $ 1 million . SOMEWORD Gary Smith , a Mail Boxes official , said the company will have to meet with the insurers to determine how the verdict will be handled . SOMEWORD CO J.MBB AIB + RTRSY The New York Stock Exchange announced the listing of two foreign banking firms . SOMEWORD Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. , Tokyo , will list American depository shares with the symbol MBK . SOMEWORD It will continue to trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange . SOMEWORD Allied Irish Banks PLC , Dublin , has started trading with the symbol AIB.PR , representing non-cumulative preference shares . SOMEWORD It is an initial public offering . SOMEWORD The American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange said they began trading put and call options on the American depositary receipts of Reuters Holdings PLC , a London news and information services company . SOMEWORD Most people hereabout have forgotten this banner headline from the Roswell Daily Record of July 8 , 1947 : `` RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region . SOMEWORD '' But a group of local men with fresh crew cuts has agreed to help NBC-TV 's `` Unsolved Mysteries '' jog a few memories . SOMEWORD On a blistering day in this desert town , they dress up as members of the Roswell Army Air Force and stand around an abandoned hangar in exchange for $ 50 , a free lunch and the chance to be a part of history as only television can tell it . SOMEWORD A dry-ice fog hangs thick inside the hangar , enshrouding a cluster of actors who , posing as MPs , guard the saucer wreckage . SOMEWORD At the building 's far end , two men in white lab coats unload four stretchers from an Army ambulance . SOMEWORD The victims , clad in silver Lycra jumpsuits , are a sight : Their flesh is orange . SOMEWORD Their oversize heads are bald and shaped like eggplants . SOMEWORD Their long , bony hands have only four digits . SOMEWORD The story `` has to be true , '' says Carol Renee Modrall , who runs the Granny 's Opera House theater at nearby Carlsbad Caverns and who was hired by the show 's producers to assist with everything from costuming to catering . SOMEWORD `` If you think about it , we had several atomic blasts around that time . SOMEWORD If I were an alien , I 'd want to come here and see what was going on . SOMEWORD '' NBC is hoping that more segments like this will exert a similar pull on earthlings . SOMEWORD In the show 's first full season last year , `` Unsolved Mysteries '' captured 16th place in the prime-time ratings with its special brand of `` docutainment '' -- re-enactments of puzzling crimes and other unexplained events , all somberly narrated by Robert Stack . SOMEWORD Although the show did air segments on Bigfoot and on people who have revived after dying , more typical was the story of Rose Hoffman , a San Jose , Calif. , mother who went undercover as a biker seeking information about her teenage son , missing since his abduction by motorcycle roughnecks in 1977 . SOMEWORD `` These are stories that could happen to my family or your family , '' says Rick Ludwin , NBC 's vice president of specials and variety programs . SOMEWORD Critics , however , have attacked `` Unsolved Mysteries '' and other `` reality '' programs , such as Fox 's `` America 's Most Wanted , '' arguing that they exploit victims and their families . SOMEWORD Questions have also been raised about the legal implications of some re-enactments . SOMEWORD In part because of such concerns , `` Unsolved Mysteries '' has decided to give added attention this season to the wiggier stories -- reality TV 's answer to Fox 's `` Alien Nation '' and ABC 's witchy `` Free Spirit , '' both new this year . SOMEWORD Mr. Ludwin says NBC has asked the executive producers of `` Unsolved Mysteries , '' John Cosgrove and Terry Dunn Meurer , for more `` high-profile '' pieces like the one about Roswell , which is scheduled to run on the season premiere Wednesday . SOMEWORD `` It 's taken TV a long time to realize that a lot of people read tabloid newspapers in the U.S. , '' says David Gritten , television critic for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner . SOMEWORD The segments are filmed where the original events occurred , using either local actors or the actual people involved . SOMEWORD Since the show does n't pay subjects to appear in re-enactments of their own stories , the latter approach saves money . SOMEWORD It also heightens believability , Mr. Cosgrove and Ms. Meurer contend . SOMEWORD Consider the case of the blinking statue . SOMEWORD For a future show , `` Unsolved Mysteries '' asked some 300 parishioners of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Ambridge , Pa. , to help re-create a much-publicized event : Earlier this year , they had seen a life-size figure of Jesus on a crucifix blink its eyes during the church 's Good Friday service . SOMEWORD As the segment was being filmed , a state trooper appearing in the re-enactment began shouting that the eyes were moving . SOMEWORD It was no act . SOMEWORD `` The entire congregation started having this full-on religious experience in front of us , '' recalls David Rajter , who produced the segment . SOMEWORD `` They were praying . SOMEWORD They were crying . SOMEWORD They were falling on the floor . SOMEWORD '' A videotape of the crucifix does n't show any eye movement , Mr. Rajter says , and a Church inquiry concluded that no miracle occurred at Holy Trinity either time . SOMEWORD Still , the trooper , Christopher Joseph Marion , stands by his story . SOMEWORD `` With God as my judge , these eyes were opening in front of me , '' he says . SOMEWORD For his part , the Rev. Ronald P. Lengwin , a spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh , worries that the show 's pilgrimage to the parish will stir up unwanted interest in the crucifix again . SOMEWORD `` I ca n't believe this story wo n't go away , '' he says . SOMEWORD `` The story got a life of its own because of the media . SOMEWORD '' NBC maintains that the sleuthing done on `` Unsolved Mysteries '' is a public service . SOMEWORD Each week , operators at a telemarketing center in Los Angeles field several thousand calls from viewers who claim to know something about the incidents dramatized . SOMEWORD Of the 128 `` solvable '' cases featured so far , the network says , 34 have been explained . SOMEWORD And of the 43 fugitives profiled , 29 have been apprehended . SOMEWORD Among them was Geraldine Elizabeth Carmichael , a Los Angeles resident who disappeared in 1980 after being convicted of bilking investors out of $ 3 million with a scheme to build a gas-saving car . SOMEWORD A viewer recognized Ms. Carmichael -- who is in fact a man undergoing treatments pending a sex-change operation -- as a flower vendor in Texas . SOMEWORD Obviously , leads about such things as Bigfoot are even more elusive than clues to a kidnapping or killing . SOMEWORD But viewers feel compelled to offer their advice nonetheless . SOMEWORD `` Some of the calls are just hilarious , '' says Greg Churpek , a college student who works as an `` Unsolved Mysteries '' operator . SOMEWORD Recently , Mr. Churpek had to listen patiently as a self-professed psychic rambled on about his knowledge of `` intimate phenomena '' and his telepathic ability to find missing persons . SOMEWORD As for what drives people to participate in the show , the desire for an answer is usually foremost . SOMEWORD And with real crimes , the process is often cathartic . SOMEWORD `` They break down , and they thank you later , '' says Dan Gomez , who directed a segment about a former California policeman named Doyle Wheeler . SOMEWORD Mr. Wheeler supervised a wrenching re-enactment of an attack last year at his home in Spokane , Wash. , during which he says two men broke in , tied him up , beat and tortured him , and then shot him and left him for dead . SOMEWORD `` Talk about group therapy , '' Mr. Gomez adds . SOMEWORD `` This is sharing emotions with 20 million people . SOMEWORD '' With the more bizarre stories , the possibility of swaying a wider audience is also a big draw . SOMEWORD Mr. Marion , the state trooper , says he chose to participate in the episode about the statue because he believes the day of judgment is near . SOMEWORD `` That 's why God picked me for this , '' he explains . SOMEWORD `` He 's trying to warn us that these are the end times . SOMEWORD '' Walter G. Haut , public-relations officer at the Roswell Army Air Force base at the time of the UFO incident , says he went on the show because he thinks it 's time Americans know the truth . SOMEWORD `` I could see covering this up in 1947 , '' he concedes . SOMEWORD `` You would have had panic . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD . SOMEWORD But the population in the U.S. is intelligent enough to handle this now . SOMEWORD '' ( When the wreckage was found , Mr. Haut wrote a press release informing the local media that a flying saucer was in their midst , but it was superseded by a second official announcement saying that a weather balloon had crashed . SOMEWORD ) Mr. Haut says he hopes his interview with `` Unsolved Mysteries '' will prod the government to come clean about the alien encounter . SOMEWORD His only concern , he adds , is that the editing process could make him and the others `` appear like a bunch of absolute idiots . SOMEWORD '' Sappho Henderson says she does n't care much whether viewers believe her story about how her late husband , Capt. Oliver Wendell Henderson , flew the saucer wreckage in an Air Force plane to another base in Dayton , Ohio . SOMEWORD `` When 'Unsolved Mysteries ' first contacted me , I had n't thought I 'd participate , '' says Mrs. Henderson , who now lives in West Hills , Calif . SOMEWORD `` But then I thought , Why not ? SOMEWORD It 's been all this time . SOMEWORD Even though there may be doubters , I 'm too old to worry about that . SOMEWORD '' Of course , skeptics abound , even here in Roswell . SOMEWORD Ruth May , an administrative assistant in City Hall who moved here in 1948 , laughs when asked about television 's interest in the alien landing . SOMEWORD `` It rears its head every so often , '' she says of the story . SOMEWORD But who 's to rule out strange doings here after learning that `` Unsolved Mysteries '' could n't film in the hangar it wanted because the Central Intelligence Agency was using it that day ? SOMEWORD `` Funny , they would n't tell us what they were doing , '' jokes cameraman Bob Wise . SOMEWORD `` But we suspect it has something to do with aliens . SOMEWORD Paris-based Eurocom hopes to conclude by late this week its negotiations with WCRS to buy a majority of WCRS 's advertising business , according to executives close to the discussions . SOMEWORD The executives said Eurocom will likely raise its 20 % stake in the advertising business to 60 % to 70 % . SOMEWORD They said among the points being negotiated is a major international role in Eurocom 's advertising business for WCRS 's most visible ad man , Jerry Della Femina , chairman of Della Femina McNamee WCRS . SOMEWORD Mr. Della Femina declined comment , and WCRS and Eurocom officials could n't be reached . SOMEWORD Eurocom has been attempting to raise its minority stake in WCRS 's ad business to a majority . SOMEWORD At the same time , London-based WCRS is negotiating to increase its own stake in its 50%-owned Carat media-buying company in France . SOMEWORD Executives familiar with the discussions said WCRS will likely buy 100 % of Carat , transforming WCRS from an advertising concern into a major media-buying firm . SOMEWORD Financial problems at Campeau Corp. prompted more factoring companies to tell manufacturers to stop shipping merchandise to Campeau 's Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores units . SOMEWORD In a related development , some off-price retailers said they have been approached by apparel makers trying to unload merchandise originally intended for sale to Federated and Allied . SOMEWORD New York-based Congress Talcott Corp. , a major factoring company that does business with many Seventh Avenue apparel companies , said Friday it had instructed vendors not to ship to stores owned by Federated and Allied . SOMEWORD Congress President Jerome Kenyon said Federated and Allied are n't behind in their bills , but he said Congress was `` concerned that Campeau would n't be able to meet their interest payments . SOMEWORD '' Campeau officials did n't return calls for comment . SOMEWORD As reported , Federated and Allied are facing a liquidity crunch caused by high debt levels resulting from their acquisition by Campeau , a Toronto-based real-estate developer and retailer . SOMEWORD Federated and Allied operate nine department-store chains , including Bloomingdale 's , Stern 's , Jordan Marsh , Abraham & Straus and Lazarus . SOMEWORD Factoring companies buy retail receivables from apparel makers and , in many cases , act as their credit managers . SOMEWORD As such , they exert considerable influence in the way apparel companies conduct their business . SOMEWORD Last week , another big factoring company , Heller Financial Inc. , also told its vendors to halt shipments to the Campeau-owned stores . SOMEWORD Mr. Kenyon said Congress substantially cut its credit lines to Federated and Allied in mid-August because of concern about Campeau 's financial situation . SOMEWORD `` We have had meetings with them trying to get better information , but we were n't satisfied , '' he said . SOMEWORD The credit lines were suspended last week . SOMEWORD If Campeau receives the $ 250 million loan it is hoping to get from Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , Mr. Kenyon said Congress would probably allow vendors to make October shipments to Federated and Allied . SOMEWORD But he said Campeau 's credit lines wo n't be increased `` until they can show us more '' financial data . SOMEWORD As concern about Campeau spread through New York 's garment district , most apparel makers simply refused to discuss their business relationships with the Campeau stores . SOMEWORD But judging by the comments from a few apparel makers , many companies apparently have halted shipments to the Allied and Federated stores . SOMEWORD MBI Merchandise Industries , a New York maker of photo albums , said it stopped shipping to Campeau clients on Friday after receiving a stop-shipment order from its factor , Barclays American Corp. , according to an MBI vice president . SOMEWORD `` When I called to break the news to the Stern 's buyer , he told me that he had received a lot of { cancellation } calls from other manufacturers , '' the MBI executive said . SOMEWORD A spokesman for Charlotte , N.C.-based Barclays American declined to comment . SOMEWORD Stern 's officials referred calls seeking comment to Campeau . SOMEWORD It was also evident last Friday that some manufacturers were n't waiting to hear good news from Campeau and were seeking to sell goods to other retailers . SOMEWORD Burlington Coat Factory , a big off-price apparel retailer based in Burlington , N.J. , was `` flooded with calls '' within the last week from manufacturers looking to sell goods , said Monroe Millstein , Burlington chairman . SOMEWORD `` Our buyers have been besieged with offers for all types of clothing across the board , '' Mr. Millstein said . SOMEWORD Off-price retailers specialize in the sale of brand-name and designer apparel at discount prices . SOMEWORD Apparel makers typically turn to them when they have excess inventory or merchandise they need to sell late in the season . SOMEWORD Most department stores have already ordered most of their fall and winter merchandise . SOMEWORD J&C Properties , Nashville , Tenn. , said it holds a 10.36 % stake in First Federal Savings & Loan Association 's common shares outstanding . SOMEWORD In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , the partnership said it holds 61,674 shares bought for $ 222,187 , including 1,000 shares bought on Aug. 15 for $ 10 each . SOMEWORD The stock was bought as an investment . SOMEWORD In Columbia , Tenn. , the bank 's president and chief executive officer , John Oakes , said he was n't familiar with J&C Properties . SOMEWORD But he described First Federal Savings and Loan as `` one of the strongest and safest thrifts in the country , '' and thus likely to attract investors . SOMEWORD Entrepreneurs rejoiced as a key congressional committee switched gears and voted to repeal one of small business 's biggest bugaboos : Section 89 of the tax code dealing with employee benefits . SOMEWORD But lobbyists fretted that small business still does n't know what substitute legislation may demand . SOMEWORD Some worried that the new law could still shackle business owners with burdensome requirements . SOMEWORD While the House Ways and Means Committee late last week voted to repeal the complex employee-benefits legislation , it also voted to replace it with a simpler provision . SOMEWORD `` This may be a significant new reform , but it does n't look like any repeal I 've ever seen , '' says John Motley , chief lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business , the largest small-business association , which has aggressively pushed for total repeal . SOMEWORD Section 89 of the tax code requires companies to distribute fringe benefits fairly among top employees and rank-and-file workers . SOMEWORD The once little-noticed provision of the 1986 tax-revision law has stirred an outcry from both business and labor groups complaining that the provisions are too confusing , and that compliance is too costly . SOMEWORD Small businesses especially have attacked the law as too burdensome to administer , claiming that companies have to pay large sums to consultants just to figure out the law . SOMEWORD In recent months , both the House and Senate have moved to curtail provisions of the law , but small-business groups have pressed for repeal . SOMEWORD While most political experts say the Ways and Means Committee turnaround on the Section 89 issue is an important victory for entrepreneurs , business owners still face uncertainties . SOMEWORD For one , it 's still unclear how the Senate will reconcile its bill to curtail provisions of the law with the new House approach . SOMEWORD Moreover , business needs to have Congress act formally on Section 89 as soon as possible so owners can decide whether to cancel or keep any new insurance plans . SOMEWORD The latest confusion began when Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski last week told three small-business groups that he had decided to reverse positions and support repeal . SOMEWORD Earlier , the Illinois Democrat had supported curtailing the law but opposed eliminating it . SOMEWORD In place of Section 89 , Rep. Rostenkowski is proposing rules setting anti-discrimination requirements . SOMEWORD These are designed to make compliance simple to determine without hiring outside help . SOMEWORD The rules would cover what Mr. Rostenkowski calls `` executive-only '' health plans and the health plans of professional service organizations , such as law firms . SOMEWORD Small companies would have to match each executive 's benefit plan with one for lower-paid staffers . SOMEWORD Larger companies would have to match the plans on a ratio of one executive to 25 other employees . SOMEWORD Not everyone is happy . SOMEWORD `` It took one tax committee four pages and seven examples to explain { the proposal } , '' says the NFIB 's Mr. Motley . SOMEWORD `` They 're saying either you offer the same plan to everybody or look ridiculous by choosing among your employees , '' he complains . SOMEWORD He also says if the Senate tries to combine those rules with the current Senate version of Section 89 , a much tougher law than the one the Ways and Means Committee proposes could result . SOMEWORD Under the Senate bill , for example , a company could be required to offer any benefits to 90 % of employees and pay at least 60 % of the costs . SOMEWORD A Senate aide familiar with Section 89 says Rep. Rostenkowski `` has moved the line with this new proposal , but he has n't abandoned the principle . SOMEWORD My gut feeling is the Senate will say if it 's a better way to go , let 's go with it . SOMEWORD '' The Rostenkowski plan , he says , would remove a tax deduction for benefit plans that the government believes blatantly discriminate between higher-paid and lower-paid employees , but would n't try to get businesses to expand coverage . SOMEWORD Some small-business groups say the worries about the Rostenkowski action are misplaced . SOMEWORD The new proposal is cause for rejoicing and `` removes a major stress factor for small businesses around the country , '' says John Paul Galles , executive vice president of National Small Business United , based here . SOMEWORD `` I feel very confident Rep. Rostenkowski will keep his promise and repeal Section 89 , '' he says . SOMEWORD Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , calls Rep. Rostenkowski 's new provisions safe harbors that are better for businesses than no rules at all . SOMEWORD `` They 're like a high jump that 's six inches off the ground . SOMEWORD They 're easy to administer and tame in what they require , '' he said . SOMEWORD `` By having them , you avoid any contention as to whether your plan discriminates or not . SOMEWORD '' Rep. Rostenkowski , in another reversal , also said he will support extending the 25 % tax deduction for personal and family health insurance for self-employed business owners , which was scheduled to expire . SOMEWORD Earlier , he had opposed the measure , a stance the NFIB has termed `` Rosty 's revenge , '' or a way of punishing the group for its stand for repeal of Section 89 . SOMEWORD A key to the action on Section 89 was the fact that a repeal bill , put forward by Rep. John LaFalce , ( D. , N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Small Business Committee , has 317 co-sponsors , enough to win full House approval . SOMEWORD Congressional aides say the House Democratic leadership was n't willing to prevent the bill from coming to a vote in order to support a powerful committee chairman . SOMEWORD Since it was clear that Section 89 would be repealed in the House , the aides say , Rep. Rostenkowski apparently decided to do it in committee , perhaps using it as a bargaining chip on other issues . SOMEWORD U.S. steel imports fell 9.7 % in July to 1,458,000 tons from year-earlier levels , according to the American Iron and Steel Institute . SOMEWORD The trade group 's compilation of Commerce Department data showed July imports were down 5.9 % from June 's 1,549,000 tons and below last year 's high of 1,979,000 tons in June 1988 . SOMEWORD Imports claimed 19.3 % of the U.S. market , which is in line with the Voluntary Restraint Arrangement Program , according to the American Institute for Imported Steel Inc . SOMEWORD Excluding semi-finished steel imports , the percentage for July was 15.2 % , below the U.S. goal of 18.5 % . SOMEWORD Rep. Lee Hamilton , the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee , wants to do a little remodeling of the Federal Reserve System . SOMEWORD His timing may seem strange , since the Fed now is generally well regarded . SOMEWORD Bert Lance , President Carter 's budget chief , once said , `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . SOMEWORD '' That theory of government , however , has often led to crash programs amid chaos . SOMEWORD Maybe now would be a good time to take a look at the Fed . SOMEWORD Mr. Hamilton 's proposals are something less than revolutionary . SOMEWORD But they could provide an occasion for a thorough examination of an important government institution , now marking its 75th year , that has often been shaped largely by happenstance . SOMEWORD The proposal that may attract the most attention would put the Treasury secretary on the Reserve Board and thus on the policy-making Open Market Committee . SOMEWORD This would be nothing new ; before passage of the 1935 Banking Act , both the Treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were ex-officio board members . SOMEWORD Congress eliminated the ex-officio members as part of the desperate effort to fix a financial system that was , indeed , broke . SOMEWORD It 's unclear just how much of a role the secretary had ever played at the Fed . SOMEWORD In arguing for removing the ex-officio members , Sen. Carter Glass said , `` When I was secretary of the Treasury , I had considerable influence with the action of the board , and I have suspected that frequently since the secretary of the Treasury has had too much influence upon the board , and I do not think he ought to be there . SOMEWORD '' The argument for having the secretary on the board is that it might diminish intragovernment warfare . SOMEWORD `` There 's a lot to be said for it , '' says William Poole , a Brown University economist and former presidential economic adviser . SOMEWORD `` It would promote clear lines of responsibility . SOMEWORD '' Mr. Poole also supports the Hamilton plan to require the Open Market Committee to announce immediately the decisions of its policy-making sessions , instead of about six weeks later . SOMEWORD `` Nearly all economists , '' says Mr. Poole , `` would favor the freest possible flow of information . SOMEWORD '' Under congressional pressure , the committee 's decisions have been announced earlier and earlier , and the Fed has often expressed fear of market disruptions . SOMEWORD The trouble has n't occurred , and few non-Fed economists see any chance that immediate disclosure would be damaging . SOMEWORD Another Hamilton proposal is to allow each incoming president to pick his own Federal Reserve chairman . SOMEWORD Chairmen , like presidents , serve four-year terms but the terms in recent decades have not coincided . SOMEWORD Jerry L. Jordan , chief economist of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles , says , `` It would be a better idea to allow a year between the arrival of a new president and the choice of a chairman . SOMEWORD That might separate the action a little from the politicking that surrounds the inauguration . SOMEWORD '' Yet another Hamilton provision would require publication of the Fed 's budget . SOMEWORD Congress has always been a little nervous about the Federal Reserve 's ability to create funds through its open market operations . SOMEWORD The late Rep. Wright Patman frequently hounded the regional Federal Reserve Banks for data , often on minor expenditures . SOMEWORD It 's hard to see , however , how publishing budgets could do any damage . SOMEWORD But published budgets alone would n't satisfy Mr. Hamilton . SOMEWORD He also wants the General Accounting Office to audit Fed procedures much more closely . SOMEWORD Mr. Jordan , however , suggests that the GAO already is a pretty busy outfit . SOMEWORD `` An agency already exists , '' he says , `` that could do the audits . SOMEWORD '' This agency is the Federal Advisory Council . SOMEWORD The council was established by the original Federal Reserve Act in 1913 . SOMEWORD There was considerable controversy over which was to run the system -- the banks or the government -- and the council was set up to monitor the system . SOMEWORD Each district had a member , and the council was empowered to get any information it wanted . SOMEWORD Until the 1930s the council was quite powerful , but it has been allowed to dwindle to a sort of public relations agency , meeting four times a year in Washington but doing very little . SOMEWORD Mr. Jordan suggests reviving the FAC to do any necessary auditing . SOMEWORD There are a number of other issues that could profitably be examined in the current non-crisis atmosphere . SOMEWORD Benjamin Friedman , a Harvard economist , argues that appointments of Reserve Bank presidents , who make government policy as members of the Open Market Committee , should require Senate confirmation ; at present , they are named by the banks ' directors with the approval of the Reserve Board . SOMEWORD There are arguments against such a change ; some analysts fear it would unduly politicize the Fed . SOMEWORD But it 's an issue well worth study . SOMEWORD Other issues : Rep. Stephen L. Neal has submitted a joint resolution that would instruct the Fed to stabilize prices -- and keep them stable . SOMEWORD Allan H. Meltzer , a Carnegie-Mellon University economist , proposes that the Federal Reserve be required to announce its plans for a coming year . SOMEWORD If it failed to achieve its aims , it would explain why . SOMEWORD The president could accept the explanation -- or accept the Fed officials ' resignations . SOMEWORD Mr. Hamilton may be starting something . SOMEWORD Greece is set to introduce over-the-counter trading in a move to expand financial services before the European Community frees the movement of capital by the end of 1992 . SOMEWORD The president of the Athens Stock Exchange , Nikitas Niarchos , said government authorization to start OTC trading is expected later this week . SOMEWORD Companies eligible to trade OTC will be relatively small , high-growth ventures with share capital of more than 100 million drachmas ( $ 590,000 ) . SOMEWORD Greece has 40,000 firms registered as small or medium-sized enterprises , but no estimate has been made of how many will be eligible for OTC trading . SOMEWORD The companies which opt to be traded OTC will raise funds directly from the capital market , bypassing high-interest bank loans , as well as red tape . SOMEWORD `` Companies in Greece are currently paying 25 % in interest rates and bank charges as opposed to around 6 % abroad , '' said Dimitris Economidis , president of Economdis Electro-Optics , whose company will be among those trading OTC . SOMEWORD `` Although share capital of 100 million drachmas is high for many businesses , OTC trading will definitely spur growth , '' Mr. Economidis predicted . SOMEWORD The new secondary market will also act as a testing ground for companies that may eventually raise the 170 million drachmas capital needed for a listing on the main exchange . SOMEWORD `` OTC trading means small and medium-sized enterprises can become living cells in the economy , '' said Giorgios Pervanas , vice president of the Athens Stock Exchange . SOMEWORD `` Those companies will have a real chance to develop , '' he added . SOMEWORD Companies that do apply to trade OTC will have to prove they are sound . SOMEWORD They must show healthy profits over a three-year period before trading approval is given . SOMEWORD Out of three published balance sheets submitted for stock exchange endorsement , the two most recent will have to be certified by an accountant . SOMEWORD Once a company gets approval to trade its shares in the OTC market , it is required to submit biannual balance sheets . SOMEWORD Companies that have been operating for less than three years will be approved for listing on a case-by-case basis . SOMEWORD Mr. Pervanas said other innovations planned by the stock exchange include the introduction of brokerage firms and fully automated trading . SOMEWORD He said two brokerage firms had been approved and would begin operating shortly . SOMEWORD The stock exchange , supervised by the National Economy Ministry , has a listing of 119 companies . SOMEWORD Trading volume in 1988 totaled 49.13 billion drachmas , down from 61.5 billion drachmas in 1987 . SOMEWORD Trading at the Athens Stock Exchange is conducted by open outcry and transactions are in cash with a 24-hour settlement . SOMEWORD Foreign investors may buy and sell freely on the exchange . SOMEWORD Orders for securities are placed directly with an official broker or through a bank operating in Greece . SOMEWORD There is no capital gains tax in Greece . SOMEWORD Microsoft Corp. said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as one million common shares from time to time in fiscal 1990 ending June 30 . SOMEWORD The software manufacturer said it planned to buy the shares on the open market to reduce the dilutive effect to shareholders of stock issuances for the company 's stock option and employee-stock purchase plans . SOMEWORD The company had 56.2 million average shares outstanding on June 30 . SOMEWORD SOMEWORD\""
